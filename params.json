It takes the form of a Chrome Extension that, when installed,\r\nintegrates Asana into your web experience in the following ways:\r\n\r\n  * Creates a button in your button-bar which, when clicked, pops up a\r\n    QuickAdd window to create a new task associated with the current web page.\r\n    It will populate the task name with the page title by default, and\r\n    put the URL in the notes, along with any text you may have selected\r\n    when you pressed the button.\r\n\r\n  * Installs the special Asana TAB+Q keyboard shortcut. When this key combo\r\n    is pressed from any web page, it brings up the same popup.\r\n    This functionality will operate on any window opened after the extension\r\n    is loaded.\r\n\r\nSee: http://developer.asana.com/\r\n\r\nFiles of special interest:\r\n\r\n  api_bridge.js:\r\n    Handles generic communication with the API.\r\n\r\n  server_model.js:\r\n    Wraps specifics of individual API calls to return objects to calling code.\r\n    This is not a real ORM, just the bare bones necessary to get a few\r\n    simple things done.\r\n\r\n  popup.html\r\n    Source for the popup window, contains the top-level logic which drives\r\n    most of the user-facing functionality.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
